                <h3>HISTORY AND FOUNDATION OF GTS</h3>
                <p>GTS is a charity non-profit organization registered with the government of Kenya under the
                    Societies Act as Society. It works cooperatively with the community and other volunteers to
                    reach out to the less privileged, the aged and street children in a mission to offer
                    guidance and counseling, support the young less privileged to unleash their potential
                    curbing the bondage of drug addiction, and give hope to the vulnerable as a way of giving
                    back to the community.</p>
                <p>Founded in 2017 by a group of Christian students in Kirinyaga, Kenya that work passionately
                    to ensure that the young generation is out from addiction bondage (drug abuse). We
                    anticipate and solve the complex barriers keeping young people from education and provide
                    relevant development opportunities to the communities.</p>
                <p>To make this possible we forge a powerful partnership with young people, governments,
                    businesses, NGOs, philanthropy, civil society organization to develop and deploy solutions
                    to unleash the potential of the next generation.
                    What’s brings us together is our faith and the love of God and therefore every action we
                    take underlies the manifestation of God’s love.</p>
